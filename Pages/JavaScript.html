        <p>
            <br> So Today We Will Learn The Basics
            <br> What Is A Variable?
            <br> Here Is An Example Of A Variable:
            <br> `let Value = 20`
            <br> That Is A Code Of Making A Variable With The Value Of 20
            <br> So Variable Store Data, Like A Number, Text/String And Boolean
            <br> Numbers Are Value Of Numbers I Guess?
            <br> String Is A Value Of Words And Random Text, To Make A String Make Sure To Put A "" Or ''
            <br> Boolean Are A True Or False Value
            <br> Did You Know?
            <br> That You Can Name A Variable Whatever You Want. For Example:
            <br> 'let HEY = true'
            <br> That Is A Variable Of A Boolean!
            <br>
            <br> What Is console.log()?
            <br> console.log() Returns A Value To The Output.
            <br> When You Return A String, For Example console.log("HEY!")
            <br> The Value Will Be In The Output.
            <br> You Can Also Return Boolean And Numbers.
            <br> Did You Know You Can Return A Variable Too.
            <br> Just Put This Code: console.log(Variable Name Here)
            <br>
            <br> What Is A Function?
            <br> A Function Perform An Action When It Is Called.
            <br> For Example: 
            <br> function functionName() {
            <br>
            <br> }
            <br> After Creating A Function You Can Put A Code In It Like: 
            <br> function functionName() {
            <br>       console.log("This Is A Function!")
            <br> }
            <br> HOLD UP!
            <br> Remember When I Said "A Function Perform An Action When It Is <b>Called</b>"?
            <br> You Must Call The Function To Run It.
            <br> Just Put This Code: functionName()
            <br> Functions Are Helpful Because You Can Run It Many Times As You Want!
            <br>
            <br> What Is Math.random()?
            <br> Math.random Picks A Random Number Between The Numbers You Want
            <br> For Example:
            <br> let RandomNumber = Math.random(1,10)
            <br> Lets Get In To This Code A Little Bit More.
            <br> Two Numbers \/\/
            <br> Math.random(1,10)
            <br> I Made A Variable Of A Random Number Between 1 And 10
            <br> Now I'm Gonna Use console.log(RandomNumber) To Find What Number Is Picked.
            <br> Sometimes It Pick A Random Number Like This: 1.394883498237497548
            <br> Well That Number Is Between 1 And 10 Right?
            <br>
            <br> What Is const?
            <br> Const Is A Variable But You Can Not Edit It.
            <br> This Is A Const:
            <br> const BOOO = "yeah"
            <br>
            <br> What Is JSON?
            <br> JSON Is A Module That Store Data.
            <br> To Create A Data Just Copy This Code:
            <br> "NameOfData": 10 // You Can Put Any Values
            <br> Making More Than 1, You Must Put A Comma.
            <br> Like This:
            <br> "MyValue": 1000,
            <br> "MyString": "Hello World"
            <br> To Access The JSON, You Can:
            <br> const JSON = require("JSON Name Or The Path")
            <br> To Create A JSON File, Make Sure To Add .json At The End.
            <br>
            <br> What Is A While Loop?
            <br> 
            <br> A While Loops Repeat A Code When A Statement Is True 
            <br> let MyVar = "Hey"
            <br> while (MyVar === "Hey") { // If The Var Is "Hey"
            <br>    console.log("Repeating...") // This Code Will <b>Repeat</b> When MyVar Is = To "Hey"
            <br> }
            <br> If A Statement Isn't True It Won't Run The Code Everytime
            <br> Try Crash Your PC. You Know I'm Joking Right?
            <br> Here Is A Script With A False Statement
            <br> let MyVar = "Hey"
            <br> while (MyVar === "Text") { // If The Var Is "Text"
            <br>    console.log("Repeating...") // This Code Will <b>Repeat</b> When MyVar Is = To "Text"
            <br> }
            <br> Well You Know The Variable Isn't = "Text"
            <br> So.... the code wont
